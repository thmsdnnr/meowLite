# meowLite

meowLite is a Chrome extension that indexes all words on a webpage and displays them in order of frequency. When you click on a word, you can paginate through each appearance of that word on the page. It's useful if you're reading an RFC, for instance. Also, the icon is a cute cat. It has the ability to run on any http/https page, but it will only run when you click the icon. Thus, it is highly performant when you're not using it, and reasonably performant when you are.

v0.1: It works and does not look exceedingly awful.
